You only have consumer rights if the item isnâ€™t as described on the advert. It should be true to what was advertised and what was said by the seller.<br>
If item is not as described, you may be entitled to the different in value between what was paid at the actual worth of the item. Or the cost of the repair. Always make sure you have any evidence to prove the faulty item.<br>
You will need to agree on the actual price of the item with the seller and then be paid the difference in value.<br>
Asking for a repair is tricker. You should ask the seller if they will cover the repair first. If they refuse, you should gather 3 different quotes for the repair, show your correspondence between the seller and yourself. Try to convince the seller to pay the repair. </p>
